# Stupid Web Reader
A stupid web txt reader for Edge read aloud.

### How to use:
* Open [StupidWebReader](https://shireny.github.io/StupidWebReader/StupidWebReader.html) from your Edge.
* Click the square button in the bottom and load your txt file.
* You know what to do.

**Beware**: 
The code is really stupid. It's meanly written by ChatGPT, with some manually bug fixes from me. It's far from perfect, but works for me.

PR is welcome, it's hard to make it more stupid.

* It saves your changes locally if you care.
* You can download the HTML to your local and open it with browser.
