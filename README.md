# Stupid Web Reader
A stupid web txt reader for Edge read aloud.

### How to use:
* Download the html, and open it in your Edge browser.
* Click the square button and load your txt file.
* You know what to do.

**Beware**: 
The code is really stupid. It's meanly written by ChatGPT, with some manually bug fixes from me. It's far from perfect, but works for me.
PR is welcome, it's hard to make it more stupid.
