A stupid web txt reader for Edge read aloud.

### How to use:
* Open [StupidWebReader](https://shireny.github.io/StupidWebReader/StupidWebReader.html) from your Edge.

* You know what to do.

### The good

**Beware**: 
The code is really stupid. It's meanly written by ChatGPT, with some manually bug fixes from me. It's ugly(Both UI and Code), but works for me.
